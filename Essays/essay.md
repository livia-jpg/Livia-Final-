# ***How can Digital Commons get sustained funding?*** 

> Digital Commons are defined as digital resources "collectively produced and maintained by communities of diverse actors", which are governed in a way that "guarantees their collective and shared nature" (O'Neil&al, 2021). These include but are not limited to FLOSS (Free Libre Open Source Software) such as Linux, wikis such as Wikipedia or web browsers such as Mozilla's Firefox. However, one of the difficulties faced by commons lies in finding viable economic models capable of remunerating those who contribute to these shared resources, while maintaining its collaborative, shared, and open nature. 
The following note will explore several revenue model scenarios used by digital commons to sustain their projects. 
In doing so, we will evaluate how efficiently each of the identified Revenue Models (RMs) can maintain a digital common's core values of non-rivalry, non-exclusivity and shared governance. 

## __External Revenue Model__

These Revenue Modesl describe external funding provided to Digital Commons that do not stem from the Common's direct output or revenue, but from outside sources that recognize the Common's value to society or its importance as an open public resource. 

- ### *Through Commoners or Individuals*

This model reliers on personal donations funding a foundation to cover fixed costs, while volunteer contributors self organize project development (Broca, 2018). Exemplified by Wikipedia, this approach represents the canonical model of digital commons, characterized by open resources, democratic governance, and peer-based production. However, its sustainability  depends on modest infrastructure costs and significant unpaid labor. The model remains vulnerable to volunteer burnout, requires contributors to have alternative income sources, and can collapse with a loss of visibility. Despite its effectiveness in some projects, it has not been widely scaled and fails to address the fundamental challenge of compensating contributors. 

- ### *Through Public funding*

Public funding initiatives such as the EU’s NGI Commons program provide much-needed support for digital commons by helping maintain the foundational structure for long periods and preserving non-rival and non-exclusive features (Labo Société Numérique, 2020). This RM is most efficient when individual monetary contributions are too few but require high developing costs. Moreover, it enables the digital common to escape profit-oriented private funding that could compromise their core principles. 
However, success depends on building trust between commoners and funding bodies to alleviate concerns about “statization and politization” which could impede the shared governance value (Krewer, 2024). This RM also faces challenges due to its reliance on political will and budget allocations. For instance, Framasoft recently expressed concerns about potential cuts to their EU-backed NGI funding, highlighting the precarious nature of such support for digital commons projects (Framasoft, 2024). 

- ### *Through corporations and Big Tech* 

In this RM, “economic actors pool investments to create shared resources that benefit all” (Broca, 2018). This model allows for the remuneration of main contributors but can lead to their reintegration into traditional employment structures and increased corporate influence over governance. Although it supports collaborative development, challenges include potential conflicts of interest and reliance on corporate funding, which may affect the independence of the common. Linux kernel is an interesting example since 45% of its revenue is due to mutualized private funding by actors such as the GAFAMs, and its code was developed with the help of Big Tech employees for several years now (Broca, 2018)(Borisov, 2024). 


## __Internal Revenue Service Model__

This revenue Model describes funding that is the result of the output of the common's project, where the digital common aims at sustaining their project through a commercial offering. 

- ### *The Freemium Model*

A freemium model refers to tiered access to a product, where a part of the product is free and the rest is restrained by a paywall. In the digital commons, this can take the form of an open-core business model for FLOSS. Open-core business models involve a “’core’ or feature-limited version of a software product as free and open-source software, while offering commercial versions or add-ons as proprietary software” (O’Neil, 2021). They are used by Gitlab for instance and can maintain wide accessibility features while generating revenue from users who require additional capabilities, especially for corporate purposes. The success of this model depends on how well-balanced the free and priced tiers of the offer to ensure the free version does not take away too much on the non-exclusivity value of the common, while making the priced version attractive enough to generate sufficient revenue. Although ‘open-core’ refers to software commons, the freemium principle can be applied to other types of commons. For instance, all Mozilla software is open source, but if one wants to use their VPN product, then an annual subscription fee applies  . Lastly, the success of this approach depends on whether the commercial offering is sufficient to cover the fixed costs as well as the cost of developing the paid model.

## __Conclusion__

The diversity of revenue models available to digital commons reflects the complex challenges of sustaining these project while preserving their open and collaborative nature. Successful common often employ a combination of these models, tailored to their specific needs and community characteristics. However, since most digital commons rely on external revenue streams, greater visibility on those projects is needed to help them gather more individual, public and corporate funding.
